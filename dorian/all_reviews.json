The piano music was for the guests to dine on, very classy for a McDonald's.   It was the 1980's and folks just wanted what Wall Street would dish out.  Them were the days when even Mickey D's was an upscale joint.\n\nIt is a hop, skip and a jump from Wall Street, a few blocks south of City Hall and the Brooklyn Bridge,  a few blocks from the Statue of Liberty cruises, and of course One World Observatory  is right around  the corner.\n\nClean, neat and tidy is how this McDonald's is run.

When I asked about this I was told that they do not give such toys out with happy meals, but if I was white I'm sure my son would have gotten one.
