They're just enough. Nothing more, nothing less. Always busy. A good place to take some food if you're in a rush or just for fun. Enjoy!\nFood: 4/5Â Â |Â Â Service: 4/5Â Â |Â Â Atmosphere: 4/5",

Not that it matters since they've arbitrarily closed off their indoor dining for months now. Whenever I feel like grabbing food in the middle of the night I think about coming here but until indoor dining is open again it's just not a good choice to go.\n\nThe ONLY thing this McDonald's has over other nearby food places is it's \"open\" 24 hours. That doesn't matter, though, because if you ever go at any unusual hour they'll tell you they're closed anyway. In other words, their ONE selling point is just blatantly false advertising.\n\nWhat a waste of prime real estate space that could go towards somewhere that actually serves food.",
