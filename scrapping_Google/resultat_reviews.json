They're just enough. Nothing more, nothing less. Always busy. A good place to take some food if you're in a rush or just for fun. Enjoy!\nFood: 4/5Â Â |Â Â Service: 4/5Â Â |Â Â Atmosphere: 4/5",

Very polite people. Not the usual. And this McDonaldâ€™s is spotless. I donâ€™t know if they are paid extra but these employees keep this place clean. Cleanest McDonalds Iâ€™ve ever been in. The wait time isnâ€™t bad either. I would have given them 4 stars if they offered a vegetarian dish. #sankofatafari #kingofcoffeenyc #mcdonalds #nyc #broadway",
