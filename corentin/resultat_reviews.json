Not this time at Piccola Cucina Estiatorio, 71 Thompson Street NYC. After seeing their extremely authentic Sicilian menu online I knew that it had to be the real thing. After easily reserving a table online we showed up with yes our hopes being very high. For the first time the food was everything I had hoped for.\n1. Arancini: nicely crunchy and flavored. Not oily or old at all.\n2. Grilled veggies: although simply presented they were really tasty and fresh.\n3. Involtini: out of this world. Exactly made like in my town in Sicily. A Moist, tender, flavored with some really tasty mozzarella cheese, served on a nice bed of caponata.\n4. Maccheroni alla Norma: finally my very favorite dish. I almost cried. Besides a fantastic pasta, rigorously cooked al dente, there was a more than generous amount of diced eggplant, obviously, with basil leaves, olive oil and everything the Mediterranean has so generously given to Sicily for thousands of years. It‚Äôs worth mentioning the more than welcome grated ‚Äúricotta salata‚Äù as a testimony to the high attention to detail of Chef Gioele. That was a dinner I will not easily forget.\nThe last thing I want to say is that, according to the highly professional and attentive staff, almost every single ingredient in this restaurant is flown directly from Sicily including the very tasty cannoli filled with ricotta cheese. (The cheese flies frozen during shipping).\nSorry for the long review. I only wanted to show my super happiness with this restaurant. ANGELO.",

We sat a two-top right next to the large open window to the front patio, after sidling in between tightly crammed tables and encouraging the table next to us to remove their purses from our seats and hold them on their laps. The small space was made a bit more uncomfortable by having very large format menus. If the physical size of the menu is greater than the distance between tables - it makes things extra challenging. In addition, the poor staff had to try to get in and around the restaurant with essentially no extra space at the serving stations, making things rough to avoid a bit of jostling.\n\nI'd prefer to come back on a quiet night (if there is such a thing) to avoid feeling so close to everyone.",

We had a seafood/veggie combo appetizer and the Sicilian rice balls. Be prepared for fish and shrimp complete with heads and eyes. My sister did not like her grilled seafood plate, it looked a little too fresh from the sea. The pastas were good but a bit too al dente. Super loud once it fills up, can't really have a conversation. Next time I'll try somewhere else. Cute little place and Spring Street is a fun area for strolling.",

I chose the Piccola Cucina Estiatorio because of the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. The restaurant fully lived up to them. The food was delicious, the service was amazing and the atmosphere was fantastic. I can't recommend this place highly enough if you want a place with great food, great service and a great atmosphere. It was perfect for my partner who likes good food and service but can't stand the pretension of overly-posh restaurants. We were a party of nine and were looked after brilliantly, from the helpful person who took my call to book the table (thank you Maria) to the wonderful staff in the restaurant who made us feel so welcome. Thank you all for making it a fantastic evening which we will remember fondly for a long time.",

Host did a great job spacing customers apart as much as possible until it got busier.\nService was fantastic and very attentive without hovering.\nEach course was served promptly but did not feel rushed.\nBurrata cheese with cherry tomato and arugula appetizer was the freshest cheese I've had a restaurant - seasoned perfectly with lovely presentation.\nI had the squid ink spaghetti with scampi langoustine and squash blossoms - the pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly with a velvety smooth and rich sauce. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had!\nDessert was very good - cannoli had perfectly crisp and flavorful shells with a delectable filling. The custard in the tiramisu and creme brulee was smooth, rich, and flavorful.\nI would highly recommend this restaurant - try to come early because it is cramped and when it fills up, you have no elbow room.\nCost is a bit pricey, but not bad for quality of food and service and location!!",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant for our last night in NYC (it was a Monday) having read the reviews and expecting the very best Italian food.\n\nCan‚Äôt help feeling a bit disappointed with our experience to be perfectly honest because it really didn‚Äôt live up to the reviews and I think maybe we were really unlucky.\n\nWe had made a reservation and when we turned up at the restaurant there was a couple just in front of us who had arrived without a reservation. Without asking us first, the guy on the door showed them straight to a table and when he then came back to welcome us, we then had to wait for about 10 minutes while he found a table (clearly he hadn‚Äôt checked the reservations before seating the other couple and/or had given our table away).\n\nNo apology, pretty inattentive service - having experienced amazing customer service in NYC, this guy definitely wasn‚Äôt someone I‚Äôd have put in charge of arrivals!\n\nWhen we were seated, there was barely any room at the tiny tables. The restaurant was very busy so consequently it was incredibly noisy and while I know this contributes to atmosphere, it was impossible to have a quiet conversation (not least because the other tables were so so close!).\n\nFood was good, but honestly I wasn‚Äôt blown away - I‚Äôve definitely had better Italian food elsewhere in NYC and in Glasgow and London.\n\nWe had the duetto bruschetta to start with burrata, porcini and truffle and guacamole and lobster. It was nice, although the truffle was overpowering and I personally am not particularly convinced by the pairing of guacamole and lobster.\n\nThen we had the Bucantini cacio e pepe with truffle and a special ravioli dish with seafood sauce and mussels.\n\nCacio e Pepe is my all time favourite Italian dish. I‚Äôm afraid I wasn‚Äôt blown away by this one. The pasta was a little more than al dente and the truffle sauce overpowered the simple cacio e pepe sauce too much.\n\nThe ravioli was filled with spinach and ricotta accompanying a very rich seafood sauce, it was nice but again a little heavy.\n\nWe had a very nice bottle of Primitivo, that was probably the highlight.\n\nGenerally the service wasn‚Äôt great - probably because it was so busy, but still. Twice in the hour we were there birthdays were announced with music so loud it could burst your ear drums - a tradition I don‚Äôt mind so much because it‚Äôs nice to make a fuss of someone on their bday but the music went on for so long, long after people had lost interest!\n\nI don‚Äôt like writing negative reviews because it is so difficult running and maintaining restaurants profitably and so all the positives should be celebrated. But this place is so highly rated I just wanted to provide some balance for travellers particularly because this wasn‚Äôt the outstanding quiet dinner I was expecting.",

This restaurant, like the name suggests, is a small kitchen, (with the 4 chef's busy within, which you can see clearly from the dining area). Whilst small they cram in a lot of guests, which ordinarily if in any other restaurant you would probably think (\"This is too cramped\") BUT at this restaurant it totally works and just adds to the amazing Italian party atmosphere that this place has, it really was fabulous and fun. The food was some of the best Italian I have ever eaten... The meatballs with mushroom and truffle to start was just divine and the ricotta ravioli with mushroom and pieces of sausage was also a dish that I didn't want to end. Prices are not too bad either with a feast of a dinner with a bottle of wine costing US$420 for 7 people. I finished sharing a traditional Sicilian dessert called a 'Cassata' with my friend (who is of Sicilian origins) and it was absolutely delicious...

They must have run out of zucchini flowers (already at 1:30pm) because there were none. My wife had the wild boar meatballs with porcini mushrooms and truffles. Both meals were okay, but not top notch Italian/Sicilian. They have very few Sicilian wines, and a lot of Tuscan / Piedmontese, which is probably understandable in the US. Sicily does have a lot of great wine producers so perhaps they aren't available here. They did have one Planeta rose, which is good, but for a popular choice Plumbago would be good.
